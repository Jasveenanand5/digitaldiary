Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a project that looks at the journey your money takes when it’s in the bank. This journey is explained across three webpages, each focusing on a different part of the process.

The first page starts with what happens when you make a purchase. It breaks down the steps your money goes through, from when you tap your card or enter your details to how the bank checks and approves the payment behind the scenes.

The second page looks at APIs – the technology that allows banks, payment systems, and shops to communicate with each other. It explains how these systems work together to process your payment in just seconds, making it simple and secure.

The final page takes a step back and explores the bigger picture of money. It explains how money works between different countries, why exchange rates matter, and includes some interesting facts about chip-and-pin technology and how it’s designed to keep your money safe.

This project is all about making the complicated world of banking and payments easier to understand, showing you what’s really happening every time you spend your money.


When you visit the webpage, the journey begins with a payment form where you’ll need to fill in details like your card number, name, and other payment information. Once you finalise and submit your purchase, you’ll be directed to the API page. This page is designed to simulate the process your money goes through in real time. You’ll stay on this page for just 20 seconds before being automatically taken to the final page.

The last page is packed with information about the history of money, how payments work, and interesting facts about the systems behind them. If you want to go back to the form, there’s a “Return to Form” button to take you there. This structure mirrors the journey your money takes when you make a payment – starting with the transaction, passing through the bank’s checks, and looping back to confirm whether the purchase is accepted or declined. The 20-second API page also symbolises how quickly your bank communicates with the company, verifies your payment, and completes the process, all in just moments.
